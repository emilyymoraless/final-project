            <h2>Why Bitwise?</h2>
                <p>Initially I had planned on becoming a teacher, specifically for elementary children since I had done a lot of
                    volunteer work at elementary schools during high school. I attended Sacramento State after I graduated high
                    school in 2016 with the intention of obtaining a bachelor's degree in Liberal Studies. I finished about 3 
                    semesters before I decided that it was not for me after all. The classes were not exciting to me and I 
                    didn't feel like I was being challenged. During my fourth semester I was convinced computer science was the 
                    career for me, it was a challenging career and it required lots of math units which I loved. During that time,
                    I also found out I was pregnant so my college plan was put on hold. I moved back to my hometown and started
                    looking for jobs instead. After my son was born I worked at a jewelry store for about a year, then a bridal boutique.
                    After a while I ended up being a stay-at-home mom instead. While at home I had a lot of time to think about what
                    my next move was. I knew I wanted to become a software engineer and thought about going back to school; but life 
                    happened and I now needed to find a way to work, in order to provide for my son and I, while also trying to pick up 
                    coding skills. While at work and discussing my interest in coding with my boss, she mentioned she had received an
                    email about Bitwise offering courses. She then forwarded that email to me and I looked over the Bitwise site and
                    instantly knew it was perfect for me; classes twice a week, class from 6pm to 9pm, the very inviting community.
