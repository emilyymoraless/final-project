                <h2>What I Cherish Most</h2>
                <p>
                    The most important thing in life to me is my family, which includes my son, of course, my parents and two brothers.
                    They are the people who have helped shape me into the person I am today; my maternal grandma was also a big part 
                    of my upbringing, she unfortunately passed during fall of 2020. She remains in my heart and plays a huge part
                    in helping me stay motivated to succeed in life. 
                </p>

                <h2>Music Preferences</h2>
                <p>
                    I am currently obsessed with Bad Bunny's new album, "Un Verano Sin Ti." Since the day it dropped on May 6th, I
                    have not been able to stop listening. I have to listen to it at least once a day in its entirety. That does not include
                    the countless amount of TikToks I come across with songs from his album. Well, I think my obsession has been proven.
                    When I was not listening to the new album I was listening to his older albums, but also, I love to listen to Cardi B, 
                    Ariana Grande, Willow, Julieta Venegas, Adele, My Chemical Romance, Paramore, Arctic Monkeys, and a lot more. I 
                    listen to and enjoy just about everything, EXCEPT, country music. Something about it is just not for me. 
                </p>

                <h2>Hobbies</h2>
                <p>
                    I really enjoy watching shows; anything from Gilmore Girls to Supernatural to Grey's Anatomy to Stranger Things.
                    My all-time favorite comfort show has got to be How I Met Your Mother. It is hilarious while also having its serious 
                    moments. The cast is so great, when I watched for the first time I was so invested in their lives as if they
                    were my real friends. I would cry alongside them when they got good or bad news. Despite the ending not being
                    what I hoped or expected, I still really love that show and find myself playing it when I have no new shows to
                    watch or just need some background noise. Other things I enjoy is going to the beach, hiking, trying out new 
                    food places, and road trips.
